Data from March 1958 through April 1974 have been obtained by C. David Keeling
of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the
Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).
Monthly mean CO2 constructed from daily mean values.
Scripps data downloaded from http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2
Monthly values are corrected to center of month based on average seasonal
cycle. Missing days can be asymmetric which would produce a high or low bias.
Missing months have been interpolated, for NOAA data indicated by negative stdev
and uncertainty. We have no information for SIO data about Ndays, stdv, unc
so that they are also indicated by negative numbers

NOTE: Due to the eruption of the Mauna Loa Volcano, measurements from Mauna Loa Observatory
were suspended as of Nov. 29, 2022 and resumed in July 2023.
Observations starting from December 2022 to July 4, 2023 are from a site at the
Maunakea Observatories, approximately 21 miles north of the Mauna Loa Observatory.
